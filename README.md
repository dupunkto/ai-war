You are battling for dominance inside an imperfect 3d maze.
You can not enter where your enemy has gone before. 
Both you and your enemy have been assigned a random starting location.

You can only specify one of six directions that you want to explore.
After you got to pick one direction it is up to your enemy to make the same choice.
Collect as much territory as possible to destroy your rival AI!

Run game.js to get started. Train your own algorithm for dominance by adding it to players.js.
