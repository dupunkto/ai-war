## The original challenge

> You are battling for dominance inside an imperfect 3d maze.  
> You can not enter where your enemy has gone before.  
> Both you and your enemy have been assigned a random starting location.  
>
> You can only specify one of six directions that you want to explore.  
> After you got to pick one direction it is up to your enemy to make the same choice.  
> Collect as much territory as possible to destroy your rival AI!  
>
> Run game.js to get started. Replace one of the two existing AIs to train your own AI for dominance.
